      Hi, I am <strong>Adam Compton</strong>, a Principal Security Consultant with more than 
      25 years of hands-on experience in penetration testing, research and development, and security automation.

    <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My career started in the mid-1990s, long before “cybersecurity” was a household word.  
      Over the years, I have worked across industries including government, small independant companies, 
      education, and Fortune 500 enterprises. I am currently employed as a penetration tester 
      at <strong>TrustedSec</strong>, where I lead engagements that range from network penetration 
      tests to physical and social engineering exercises.
    </p>

    <h2>Speaking Engagements</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve been honored to present at major security conferences around the world, including 
      <strong>DerbyCon, DEF CON, Black Hat, BSides,</strong> and <strong>HackCon</strong>.  
      My talks often focus on the human side of InfoSec — the mistakes, the learning, 
      and how to keep moving forward.
    </p>

    <h2>HillbillyStorytime</h2>
    <p>
      HillbillyStorytime is a personal project that blends Appalachian “Jack Tales” 
      storytelling with information security. It is my way of teaching and sharing lessons 
      through stories — sometimes humorous, sometimes painful, but always with a point.  
      The stories are shared on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@HillbillyStorytime" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, 
      at conferences, and here on this site.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond Security</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of InfoSec, I enjoy programming, roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, 
      and spending time with my family. I also have a deep interest in Appalachian folklore 
      and culture, which often inspires the creative side of my projects.
